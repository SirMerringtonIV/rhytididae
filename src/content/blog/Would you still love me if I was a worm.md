This week we asked our players "Your partner is turned into a worm! Would you still love them? Why or why not" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>it would be difficult. How should we speak with each other - telepathy is not invented 
>yet. How should i find her between other worms if she goes to worm party? 
>Probably, not<br>

>That's crazy but maybe<br>
>-<cite>Blace</cite>


>Perfect<br>

>Yeah I suppose. They are my partner after all! Gotta get them set up in a lil 
>terrarium or some such<br>
>-<cite>Echoes</cite>


>Duh I don’t wanna live without em. I love them more than life and been with them for 7 
>almost 8 years now. We’ve grown up together and grown together as a couple. I couldn’t 
>imagine life without them. Even as a worm…. Annnnd I get to dress her up all cute in 
>worm outfits hehe<br>

>I would still love them because at the end of the day, love doesn’t go away in an 
>instant. I wouldn’t be attracted to them though, they’re a worm. I’m not into bugs<br>
>-<cite>Kaiju</cite>


>I'm a night owl and owls don't eat worms, so of course I still love my squirmy man! Now I can put him in my pocket! Hush, owls have pockets, didn't you know?<br>
>-<cite>KarismaticAlbino</cite>


>Nope, it’s a worm<br>
>-<cite>Kubisk</cite>


>of course I would. earthworms have five hearts, so they have five times the capacity for love<br>
>-<cite>Lampside</cite>


>If they’re a gummy worm, yes. Otherwise, I’d still love them till food ran out. After that, they’re going on a hook as bait<br>

>Probably<br>
>-<cite>Mars</cite>


>I would love them no matter what. So much so that I would cut them in half so they become 2 worms, and keep doing so until they multiply to become enough worms to form back in to a human shape<br>
>-<cite>Merri</cite>


>Yes! Assuming they maintain their mind, but in a worm body. Cuz then they're just a worm now. I would find a new partner though, because I'm fairly certain I would crush a worm if I tried to cuddle with them. If they turn into a *giant* worm, then I would still find another partner because... I do still have limits and needs.<br>

>Of course my love could be a worm, there's nothing finer to be. They would make a fine gardening companion, a pal to hungry birds and if you're in a fix, handy with a machete. I reckon they'd be a whizz at putting up the Xmas tree and decorating the fire come bonfire night, they can sit on top the flames and burn in hell for whatever sins caused them to be turned into a worm and making my life a lonely paradise of worm speak<br>

>I would love our last fishing trip together…<br>
>-<cite>Ragnar</cite>


>Bold of you to assume my partner isn't already a worm.<br>
>-<cite>Shnail</cite>

>no, im not a bird.<br>
>-<cite>Sinksmith</cite>


>only if mongolian death worm cos mongolian death worm<br>
>-<cite>Siri</cite>


>Cats. They're clearly already judging us in silence... imagine we could hear that snark out loud?<br>
>-<cite>Snailady</cite>


>i'm single :( but i'd find a nice pot of dirt for them :)<br>
>-<cite>Snailcayn</cite>


>I would! From a distance...<br>
