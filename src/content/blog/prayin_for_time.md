This week we asked our players "Would you choose to live in a computer simulation if it will make you a lot happier?" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>We’re already in a simulation and it’s not fun, 3/10 not having a good time<br>
>-<cite>Snailor</cite>

<br>
<br>


>Yes<br>
>-<cite>Abner</cite>


>The existential dread of living in two simulations would be too much<br>
>-<cite>Blace</cite>


>There’s arguments we already are and I still get unhappy from time to time. But yes I would. Matrix me up dawg blue pill pls<br>
>-<cite>DeezNutz</cite>


>who says we are not already? Last Thursdayism cannot be challenged))<br>
>-<cite>DraKot</cite>


>No. I think forging ahead even in the face of adversity is what makes us who we are, and coming out the other side to better horizons is what makes life worth living.<br>
>-<cite>Echoes</cite>


>Depends if I age on the outside while in it. If I didn’t then yeah I could end it whenever and live a second life kinda cool<br>
>-<cite>Gingerred</cite>


>Only if you could get upgrades for your simulated self, I want to be the chosen one<br>
>-<cite>Kaiju</cite>


>They would need to be better than they are now but I could see myself choosing that.<br>
>-<cite>kierly</cite>


>Probably yes, but I think thoughts about how different reality is from simulation will not give me chance to forget reality)) 🙃<br>
>-<cite>Kilosaw</cite>


>Aren’t we already living in one? I’ve had Déjà vu recently so many times, I KNOW there’s a glitch in the Matrix!<br>
>So, with that assumption, a simulation inside of a simulation might make me a lot happier…. If I was also a billionaire with a heart and had no medical conditions<br>
>-<cite>luigi0706.</cite>


>Nope️<br>
>-<cite>Mars</cite>


>Absolutely, even if I knew it was, I wouldn't care. If it brings me a happier life I can live in ignorance for that!<br>
>-<cite>Merri</cite>


>No. It absolutely sucks when you realize that an accomplishment you were proud of wasn’t real<br>
>-<cite>MrSnailio</cite>


>I know I usually try to go for the Haha Silly answer, but this is genuinely hard to answer. I think it depends on if I'm aware that it's a simulation, and if the people I leave behind here are aware of what has happened. If I and everyone is aware, I don't know that I would go. I've suffered from severe depression for a long time, and I've been hospitalized for it because I was desperate to be happy *somewhere, anywhere.* Since I've been medicated and go to therapy I'm not as severely depressed, and I can see that even if I'm not happy all the time there are a lot of people here who are happier with me in their lives. That's what keeps me going when days get rough.<br>
>If I'm aware, but everyone else just forgets about me, I might go. I'll surely miss people, but if I'm happy and the people I care about aren't going to hurt in anyway then I'd seriously consider it.<br>
>If I'm not aware and they're not aware, then yeah probably just as long as I'm not going to be giving my free will over to someone who traps me in the basement to paint, or removes the ladder while I'm swimming.<br>
>-<cite>NoelEnough</cite>


>Already, when gazing over the rolling hills of municipal waste, the discarded ends of fun once had, I feel the cold dregs of happiness now laying unloved in decay. Yet slowly, here, even the smallest perceptions of happiness will start pooling together, until oneday, staring over this desolate heap, I'll see great mounds of happiness reformed, bringing joy once more and forever<br>
>-<cite>OHeck</cite>


>No<br>
>-<cite>PermeatingMass</cite>


>Yes, but not till later in life.<br>
>-<cite>Ragnar</cite>


>i would if i could still feel physically like you can irl otherwise im going with no i wouldnt want to leave that kind of experience behind<br>
>-<cite>Siri</cite>


>I mean, sure! Imagine being able to have a world that's custom built to your happiness. Our perception of the world is already individualized, so why not be customized?<br>
>BTGGs for all that want them!<br>
