This week we asked our players "You are given unlimited funds to track down and prove bigfoot exists. Tell me your plan." 

Here are their answers!

>then i rent a helicopter, pack survival kits, and bring enough beer to keep my dwarf happy. next stop: everest.<br>

>I use the money to create a chain of moonshine distilleries across all mountain ranges in the US,

>Buy up all the worlds shavers then sit back and wait for the evidence to reveal itself. Actually I'm pretty convinced it's Bert propping up the bar in the estate pub. He's got a suspiciously 
>gruff laugh, fierce b.o. and hair that crawls from his face to entwine with his humongously large feet. My mate Ken says he looks like the missing link of Bernard Bresslaw. You'd be pretty 
>convinced too with the way he does "Streets of London" at karaoke on a Thursday night. Sublime.<br>

>-<cite>Echoes</cite>

>So I dress up as a super sexy Bigfoot female ‚ÄúBigfeet‚Äù as they‚Äôre known. And stand under a cage in the woods doing sexy interpretive dances. 
>He comes to get him a little bit of this tail then I click the comically large red button that drops the cage. Boom proof (to just me) then I 
>let him go so he can be free *might let him tap if he‚Äôs nice enough* then go on about my life knowing the truth.<br>

>Audio and video equipment everywhere. On every tree. IR heat cams and 8k video. All fed live into a singular command center. Anything that moves would be

>-<cite>Mars</cite>

>I hire a crack team of investigators to hunt for bigfoot in the woods, when after a while they can't find him, I mimic his call with a whistle. This will lure him towards me where I will then catch him in a net that is hidden under a pile of leaves.<br>

>Well I am going to need a big search party so I will grab all of my friends and head to the mountains. Since I have no idea where to start we will pick the best mountain resort. 
>Studies show that long hours reduce efficiency so only spend a few hours enjoying nature then regroup over an expensive meal every day. I am sure we will find him soon but until then better throw a stress reducing party<br>
>-<cite>MrSnailio</cite>

>I'll pay whoever needs to be paid to be given access to SCP-1000. If that's a bust, I'll move into a remote cabin in the Pacific Northwest and live off the grid for as long as it takes 
>to build the trust of the local bigfoot population and join their society because it has to be better than the rest of the US right now. I'll be the littlest bigfoot.<br>
>-<cite>NoelEnough</cite>

>Plan: Use AI to map Bigfoot sighting hotspots, then deploy drones, thermal cameras, and environmental DNA testing in key areas. Field teams collect non-lethal evidence (hair, prints, saliva) with scientific and ethical rigor. 
>All data is analyzed in real time and verified by independent labs. Findings are transparently released to prove or debunk the creature‚Äôs existence once and for all.<br>

>Obviously, my first move is going to be to build an underground bunker in the forest. There will be cameras and infrared detectors throughout the forest. Finally, there will be a sign put at random places in the forest that has a picture of me

LOGLINE

When a billionaire tech mogul funds the most advanced expedition in history to uncover the truth behind the Bigfoot legend, a diverse team of scientists, soldiers, and skeptics ventures deep into the American wilderness‚Äîonly to find that the creature they‚Äôre chasing may not be a myth‚Ä¶ and may not be alone.

SYNOPSIS

After the sudden disappearance of his father in the Olympic Mountains‚Äîlong believed to be chasing the Bigfoot myth‚Äîreclusive tech genius Gideon Voss (Oscar Isaac-type) launches ‚ÄúProject Wildman‚Äù, a privately funded $1B expedition to end the mystery once and for all.

His team includes:
    ‚Ä¢    Dr. Asha Talwar ‚Äì A decorated evolutionary biologist haunted by a failed research mission in the Congo. (Priyanka Chopra)
    ‚Ä¢    Jack Reddick ‚Äì A grizzled ex-special forces tracker and wilderness survivalist. (Josh Brolin)
    ‚Ä¢    Maya Stone ‚Äì An AI prodigy who believes Bigfoot is just mass delusion‚Ä¶ until her software starts predicting movement patterns that shouldn‚Äôt exist. (Kaitlyn Dever)
    ‚Ä¢    Hawke ‚Äì A native Quinault guide with ancestral knowledge and a personal vendetta. (Zahn McClarnon)

As they deploy cutting-edge surveillance drones, DNA traps, and AI monitoring systems, the team begins to detect anomalies‚Äîfootprints too large, howls at night, strange glyphs carved into trees. But what begins as scientific exploration turns into a deadly game of survival.

The creature is real. Intelligent. Watching them.
And it‚Äôs not alone.
