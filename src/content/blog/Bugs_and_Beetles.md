This week we asked our players "As we are reaching the 2 year anniversary of Super Snail this month, tell me your favourite thing about being in Rhytididae" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>-<cite>Clithero</cite>

>The fact that no matter what we will accept you if you are a decent person and not a bigot. You will always be welcome here 
>in that regard. Also made friends across the world I never would have imagined having. Love this silly snail game!<br>
>-<cite>DeezNutz</cite>

>-<cite>Kaiju</cite>

>I am really glad I've stumbled upon this club because I've met a lot of beautiful supporting people here. I was surprised to see a 
>"safe_place" channel and went through it just to see how respectful and supportive you are to each other. Special mention to BW who I

>-<cite>Merri</cite>

>I love how it's very chill, but still goal oriented. Everyone is doing what needs to be done to suceed in the SW, but mods and leaders aren't constantly

>constantly badgered, even when they were offline.<br>
>-<cite>NoelEnough</cite>

>No pressure organization!<br>

>makes the game relaxing and fun!<br>
>-<cite>RockBadger32</cite>

>I enjoy the sense of punching above our weight when we beat clubs who have more power than ours - especially as a smaller snail in the club, it's nice to be able 
>to work together to become more than the sum of our parts/shells. And the banter is pretty good too.<br>
>-<cite>Shnail</cite>

>The way Rithlylings care about each other. Not only inside the game, but in real life (Mental health, safe space, etc)<br>
>Never expected such a great community inside a snail game.<br>

>The homies<br>
>-<cite>Snailor</cite>

>Mashing the Steve button, no doubt<br>
>-<cite>Stationaryevent</cite>
