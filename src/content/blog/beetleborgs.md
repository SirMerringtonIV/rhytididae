This week we asked our players "Toot toot complain train time! What is something that‚Äôs currently annoying you? Let it out snails üêå" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>I work in IT. 2000 characters is not enough for all the things annoying me.<br>
>-<cite>ObiJimbob</cite>

>Notifications never work and it only working when I open the app. If I wanted to know that I'm logging in why do I need to know when I'm logging in?<br>
>-<cite>Blace</cite>


>I want to buy an RV to travel with the family but we don‚Äôt have enough property to store it and I don‚Äôt want to have to pay to park it at a storage facility<br>
>-<cite>Diskolemonade</cite>


>so many things to do and so little time to handle it. Money needs is most annoying thing of all life, and we have to work 1/3 of our life. Some kind of Matrix scenario seems good already - you are mentally happy in that world and machines feed your body to get electricity of it. So tired)<br>
>-<cite>DraKot</cite>


>Sending in job applications and not even getting an e-mail in response üòî<br>
>-<cite>Echoes</cite>


>I applied for a engineering position at my job (an introduction position) and I‚Äôm over qualified for it. But since I work at Lego currently, they‚Äôre saying I have to be in my position for 18 months‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs maybe like one person in the whole building that‚Äôs been there that long. But they won‚Äôt even look at my resume because of it<br>
>-<cite>GingerRed</cite>


>Honestly I really can't complain about anything, which is surprising given what I've been through recently. But everything is alright at the moment üòÑ<br>
>-<cite>GoblinGuide</cite>


>My husband refuses to see the parallels between the current American atmosphere and 1939 Germany . It's coming, and if we don't hurry, we'll be lost. He refuses to even consider the notion of leaving America. I'm seriously trying to decide if I need to take our children and leave without him. I won't live in a country where I've been declared an enemy of the state for the heinous crime of voting Democrat<br>

>Mosquito in my room - it's very annoying, I cannot catch it<br>
>-<cite>Kilosaw</cite>


>My mom was in a car accident a week ago. Police state it was 100% the other drivers fault, insurance states it‚Äôs 100% my mom‚Äôs fault. I had to fight with her to talk to an attorney. And now she is putting off getting the medical tests she needs because she‚Äôs afraid of the cost, but she‚Äôs not young and has MS, so ignoring her physical injuries will be detrimental. She‚Äôs stubborn and I‚Äôm stubborn. I want to shake some sense into her, but it‚Äôs useless. I don‚Äôt want the stress of having her rely solely on me for her physical, mental, and emotional care.<br>

>All my work trips away are keeping me away from my wife :(<br>
>-<cite>Merri</cite>


>Apparently we are all stardust caught in a string of reality floating in the vastness of space. I can't find anything annoying about that, it's just too darn fascinating. Oh wait, the perfectness of being that's annoying, also the fact we can only experience now as a past event and while we're on the subject, it's the things we don't know we don't know that really bugs me. But I'm fine with that.<br>

>Personal Property Tax in Missouri. You bought something, now every year you owe us for keeping that thing<br>
>-<cite>Ragnar</cite>


>nothing and i mean NOTHING is more fucking annoying than a website that is not designed with any kind of nice pleasant positive interaction with the user i LOVE going round and round and round the same pages over and over and over cos you made all the hyperlinks 1: go in a circle 2: not have your hyperlink attached 3: go back to the home page despite that not being the intended direction. this is done best when you mix and match these 3 and also make your pages not even indexed properly so i cant search in the search bar I HATE IT SO MUCH<br>

>I feel attacked by my seasonal allergies and the weather in NY<br>
>-<cite>Snailady</cite>


>i needa nap :(<br>
>-<cite>Snailcayn</cite>


>Children that admittedly know nothing about what they are supposed to be learning, but not paying any attention üôÉ<br>
