This week we asked our players "If animals could talk, which would be the rudest, and why?" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>Seagulls. They already heckle us for food *without* their words. Think what they would say if they could talk‚Ä¶<br>
>-<cite>Echoes</cite>

<br>
<br>

>Maybe old tortoises because I feel like they've earned grumpy old person status and can say whatever they want.<br>
>-<cite>Azhure</cite>

>Monkeys or apes, they are the closest to humans tbf<br>
>-<cite>Azrael</cite>

>Squirrels<br>
>-<cite>Blace</cite>

>The flea. The big reveal is in it's autobiography, Stanislas de Rhodes (Edward Avery). 
>That flea gets down... and low, real low<br>
>-<cite>Clithero</cite>

>Cats are rude with their eyes and demeanor, I can‚Äôt imagine if they could talk too<br>
>-<cite>DeezNutz</cite>

>Cats, because all they would do is either demand stuff from you or judge you harshly<br>
>-<cite>diskolemonade</cite>

>üê¥<br>
>-<cite>DraKot</cite>

>That dog in me<br>
>-<cite>GingerRed</cite>

>Chihuahuas. Considering how rude they are already without being able to speak, imagine 
>the amount of cussing out they would do<br>
>-<cite>Kaiju</cite>

>NGL I'm going with humans. Apologies, I know that isn't what you meant, but nothing could be worse than us<br>
>-<cite>KarismaticAlbino</cite>

>Cats, just a guess<br>
>-<cite>Kubisk</cite>

>Cats<br>
>-<cite>Mars</cite>

>In the same way that small chihuahuas are the meanest dogs, I feel like the smaller animals would the rudest... 
>something like a small rodent. Fieldmice always look cute, but I bet they're right bellends!<br>
>-<cite>Merri</cite>

>Cats: ‚ÄúWTF is this shit on the table‚Äù<br>
>-<cite>MrSnailio</cite>

>Dolphins or elephants. Because I feel like they're smart enough as is that they'll have a lot of strong opinions 
>about humanity and would love the opportunity to vent<br>
>-<cite>NoelEnough</cite>

>Seagulls would probably be the rudest animals if they could talk. They already act entitled‚Äîstealing fries straight 
>out of people‚Äôs hands, screaming at each other over scraps, and dive-bombing anyone who gets too close to ‚Äútheir‚Äù 
>territory. If they had words, they‚Äôd likely insult you while taking your food, brag about their aerial skills, and 
>loudly argue with anyone nearby. Their abrasive squawks already sound like they‚Äôre shouting curses, so giving them 
>actual language would only amplify the attitude. In short, seagulls combine the loudness of a heckler, the boldness 
>of a thief, and the patience of a toddler‚Äîwhich makes them perfect candidates for the title of rudest talking animal.<br>
>-<cite>Ragnar</cite>

>Swans cos they have that attitude already and i think that would definitely translate over<br>
>-<cite>Siri</cite>

>Cats. They're clearly already judging us in silence... imagine we could hear that snark out loud?<br>
>-<cite>Snailady</cite>

>I just feel like koalas would be hella sassy despite their laziness and appearance<br>
>-<cite>Snailcayn</cite>

>Geese, have you seen those things‚Ä¶<br>
>-<cite>Snailor</cite>
