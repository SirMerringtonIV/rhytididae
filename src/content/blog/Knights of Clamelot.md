>Its time to implement my step by step plan
>1. In our latest shooter you pay by the bullet that you fire, we put discounts on mags and just to make sure people 
>cant get an idea of what they spend we bill them at the end of each month, these things cost money people!<br>
>2. Our world doesn't have free healthcare, why can they heal for free?? if there is a healing mechanic in our game 
>you don't currently have to pay for, well now you do! each damage state or each point of health restored now has a 
>value, this shall be added to the bill.<br>
>3. Respawning is hurting our bottom line they just get to go again, for FREE, we can't be having this, you must pay 
>for each respawn, onto the bill it goes.<br>
>4. now you may be thinking, no one will play if this is so! well here is the good part, we are bringing back gambling 
>but instead of skins and the like its you gamble with your bill, ranking highly in a match gets you a fixed amount 
>removed meaning that *if* someone was good enough they wouldn't have to pay and could even make some money but it 
>will be done in such a way that 99% of players still are making us money.<br>
>5. If they have previously bought our game the eula will be updated to legally bind them to a set amount of matches 
>a day or there will be a charge added to bill, many will not read and just blindly accept.<br>

>family member<br>
>-<cite>Snailor</cite>

>Crazy idea... But, what if we DIDN'T do microtransactions and instead just raise the prices of our games slightly to 
>compensate? That way, some of the people that normally wouldn't buy dlc's would chip in and still get access, while 
>the people that would normally pay get a bit of a break.<br>
>Or we make them subscribe to a monthly service to keep playing the game...<br>
