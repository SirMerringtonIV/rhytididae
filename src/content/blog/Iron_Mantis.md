This week we asked our players "Time to play D&D! What character are you creating? Be as detailed as you like" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>A Goliath rogue. I carry a great sword. When I'm hiding, I crouch into a heap on the 
>ground and pretend I'm a boulder. If I'm not in a place where there's rocks, I pretend 
>I'm a tree. If I'm indoors? I'm a stone pillar.<br>

<br>
<br>

>A Paladin<br>

>Same character I always make - murder hobo<br>
>-<cite>Azrael</cite>

>Never played D&D before, but I guess I'll go with what my profile picture is with a 
>female elf? For class, I guess anything with a bow or something agile.<br>
>-<cite>Blace</cite>

>Fav character I did was Miles Gilderoy. Super pretty, super hot, blonde beefcake. 
>Also super dumb and can’t read. Got by on his looks alone and was super shallow. 
>Basically a himbo pally<br>
>-<cite>DeezNutz</cite>

>Chadwick Boomfist was born from a divine blessing, a cursed gym mirror, and a surge of eldritch 
>energy during a thunderstorm on leg day. A devout follower of “Brodin, God of Gains,” he trains 
>for battle in holy squat temples and blesses protein shakes before every quest.<br>
><br>
>His divine mission? Smite evil. Crit harder. Never skip biceps.<br>
><br>
>He runs an MLM (Multi-Level Magics) scheme to sell enchanted supplements and uses his pact weapon as a demo tool.<br>
>-<cite>DiskoLemonade</cite>

>wombat-wizard with earth magic!<br>
>his adventure starts then devil sealed all underground burrows and exiled all wombats on the surface. Of course devil started to use 
>their burrows as complete infrastructure for his hell<br>
>they traveled long time until met a Dragon, who was obsessed by their cuteness and agreed to help them revenge back<br>
>he teached most gifted wombats to use magic and promised them to help<br>
>also conjured burrows-like little city on surface to stop their sad travelling in search of home<br>
>so my character have big charizma and magic stats, also a bulletproof butt, and can cause earthquakes just by jumping<br>
>-<cite>DraKot</cite>

>I think I would revisit a character I made once that never saw a resolution to their story!<br>
>In the Eberron setting, I had made a character named Flicker who was a Chronurgy Wizard. Growing up in Sharn, the city of Towers, 
>Flicker's family ran a small newspaper called the Sharn Gazette. Their principles were to always report the truth regardless of 
>how it would reflect on the city of Sharn or the dragonmarked families who made their homes in the city of towers.<br>
>One night when Flicker was out when he really was not supposed to be, he happened upon someone being killed and reported it to the 
>guards, only for the event to be covered up by the powers that be. The consequence of that was Flicker's dogged determination to 
>always make sure the truth would come to light and justice be served no matter how dangerous that truth may have been. This would 
>eventually lead to him dabbling in magic that could manipulate the flow of time so that he could find out what really happened the night that set everything into motion.<br>
>That campaign died a few years back but I really would have liked to see where Flicker's adventure would have taken him :)<br>

>Little redheaded gremlin that has hobbit like feet<br>

>-<cite>kamik0r0su</cite>

>"I once found a strange book hidden in our family library. My family is fairly wealthy, so no one paid much attention to what I was reading. 
>The book told the story of a divine being—or perhaps a concept—called the Boundless Knowledge. According to the text, it was possible to 'touch' 
>this domain by abandoning one's physical form and becoming an astral being of pure knowledge. Since that day, I’ve been obsessed with discovering 
>the truth behind it. I chose to become a wizard to pursue this path—to seek the Boundless Knowledge, and perhaps, one day, become something more than mortal."<br>

>-<cite>Merri</cite>

>Warlock woman. Old lady that looks like Auntie Ethel's real form from bg3. She made a deal with an eldritch deity to win a bake off, 
>and ever since she's been a little bit air headed, but she's hands down the best baker in the known realm. Unfortunately, there can be 
>some side effects after consumption that include but aren't limited to: hearing voices, seeing shadows that follow you in the corner 
>of your eye, mild indigestion, developing a taste for seafood, speaking in tongues, the irresistible urge to walk into the ocean, and persistent headaches.<br>
>Her familiar is a white lamb that looks like it was drawn by Disney named Philomina. She has a fifth leg that grows from her chest and instead of bleating, she makes dinosaur noises.<br>

>-<cite>RockBadger32</cite>

>Name: Big Joe<br>
>Race: Elf<br>
>Description: Small, pretty, enlightened, and with a big presence. Also has a soft voice<br>
>Class: Sorcerer (She can cast every elemental on earth)<br>
>Age: 25<br>
><br>
>Big Joe is a young elf with a rare and risky gift. She can control all four elements—earth, fire, water, and air—but there’s a catch. She can only use her power 
>once per fight, and when she does, she blacks out for five minutes, because of that, she always needs people she trusts by her side. Every fight is a risk, 
>so she only acts when it really matters.<br>
><br>
>She is fueled by the memory of her father, a powerful elemental mage who died in the war between elves and orcs, also her dream is to go beyond what he achieved 
>and become the most powerful sorcerer her people have ever seen.<br>
><br>
>But there’s a problem, the elven council do not trust her. They think her power is too unstable and have blocked her from moving up in the magical ranks. 
>To reach her goal, she’ll have to prove she’s not just her father’s shadow, and that she’s in control of her own magic.<br>
><br>
>She hates orcs with everything she got, but weirdly loves humans. She sees something real in them—messy, brave, and full of heart. Joe is straight to the point, 
>loyal to the end, and way tougher than she looks.<br>
>-<cite>Simas</cite>

>Context: this is a character i pitched for joining a party mid game in a proper fantasy dnd setting. <br>
>You are the most average guy, office worker going about his shift. You have average stats 10s in all but int 14 and wis 12. You have no combat expertise or experience 
>no perks and feats (but a fast learner though) and your inventory is: half eaten sandwich (you were on your lunch break) phone and wallet (both useless) and your work clothes. 
>You were magically kidnapped into the middle of a dungeon by the parties magic user due to a particularity strong and strange wild magic surge. Sure hope you do nothing 
>to hinder your very new found and looking companions as you speedrun the 7 stages of grief and attempt to adjust to your new life<br>
