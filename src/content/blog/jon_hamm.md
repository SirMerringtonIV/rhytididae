This week we asked our players "If you could time travel to any time past, present or future, when would you go?" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>Id travel to 45 minutes ago. I changed my mind; I don’t want this salad, I want mac n cheese!!!!<br>

>Sometime recent enough to make some lucrative investments while keeping on with life as it is cause who knows what the past or future have to offer me individually<br>
>-<cite>Azrael</cite>


>Probably the future to grab something that can tell me events, release dates, movies, lottery numbers.<br>
>-<cite>Blace</cite>


>I don't really have an answer for that, maybe to a time when my grandfather was still around to spend some more time with him, ask him questions about life.<br>
>-<cite>CallMeMaui</cite>


>Back to 2008 when the recession hit and buy a ton of Apple stock before the release of the iPhone<br>
>-<cite>Diskolemonade</cite>


>Distant future because surely all of our problems will have been solved by then.<br>
>-<cite>Echoes</cite>


>I think I’ve already time traveled to the present?! Joking aside probably go back and spend one more Christmas with my great grandma. If I’m able to go all around I’d go back and save people I care about if I was able to<br>
>-<cite>Gingerred</cite>


>If it's a one time travel option without coming back to the present, I would choose the future. Like maybe 500 years from now on. If the travel is reversible, I would peek at the past.<br>
>-<cite>kamik0r0su</cite>


>To any time my mom was still alive, even if it was just long enough for a hug<br>
>-<cite>KarismaticAlbino</cite>


>Past times were too different from now — it’s hard to understand the human flow of thought in the past. The same problem exists with the future.<br>
>The only option is time travel to the present. And while space-time is technically one whole thing, it’s really just teleportation. 🙃<br>
>-<cite>Kilosaw</cite>


>Slightly into the future to find out what to invest in and make a ton of money<br>
>-<cite>Mars</cite>


>I would go back in time to the past, the future is too uncertain and I could end up seeing a scorched world and nothing interesting, but I know with history I could go back and experience an unforgettable moment in history. Something like the pyramids being built, or the gardens of babylon<br>
>-<cite>Merri</cite>


>I'm really torn between going back in time to see dinosaurs, or going back to warn my younger self about things and tell him to get in on the GameStop stocks<br>
>-<cite>NoelEnough</cite>


>2025 past to drink fresh glacial water, breathe fresh air and to hear the quiet. 2025 yrs ahead just to give the senses an overdose of future and be a facination of the modern as "RetroBeing" or "PastPerson". 1million years ahead just to feel the journey<br>
>-<cite>OHeck</cite>


>I think being the last advanced civilisation alive would be fun, I imagine it would be one huge big party. Specifically at the final few years. Just one forever massive party into the black hole that’s about to consume everything that ever was and ever will be again (assuming white holes are real which I am)<br>
>-<cite>Pengu</cite>


>If I could travel back into my past body, with all my knowledge and experience, I would probably want to go back to college (was an art major) and to play volleyball again.<br>
