This week we asked our players "You are given unlimited budget to create the media (film, game, book etc) of your dreams! What do you make?" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>I've had an idea in my head for writing a book for a decade - a major city surrounded by
> a river that is home to a monster infestation. Humans, once infected, transform at 
>sunset into 8-foot monstrosities with a need to consume human flesh and an allergy to 
>running water. Anyone they bite but don't kill becomes a monster the next evening. The 
>monsters transform back to humans at sunrise. The government wants to contain the 
>infection but keep the public from finding out in case of panic, so they send in a 
>special forces team to control the infection. and the book follows the team as they 
>hunt down the monsters and try to prevent the spread.<br>

>purchase rights for some games of childhood, for example remake heroes of might and 
>magic 3 with modern arts, and maybe some other<br>
>-<cite>DraKot</cite>

>I would make a open world that is HUGE like Skyrim. Would have a survival mode or 
>regular. It would have extensive magic system, black smithing, etc. it would have a 
>journal where you record any monsters or enemies and can read lore about them as well. 
>It would have different dimensions and deities. Lot of relics to collect too<br>
>-<cite>GingerRed</cite>

>One solid tv show for dragonball with no conflicting timelines or plot holes ðŸ¥² and 
>definitely no GT<br>
>-<cite>Kaiju</cite>

>BioShock 4 sigh<br>
>-<cite>KarismaticAlbino</cite>

>I acquire the studio/people behind Balatro and Slay the Spire, and make it so that 
>whenever you complete a run/reach a score threshold, you can grief another persons run 
>for the opposing game.<br>
><br>
>Oh and Darksouls Monster Hunter mashup. Need a grimdark monster hunter.<br>
>-<cite>KeanuReeee</cite>

>Of course it must be not just game, but rather game mechanic patent. It's about using 
>AI and neutral networks for making characters and worlds more versatile and to process 
>interactions even beside player. ðŸ™ƒ<br>
>-<cite>Kilosaw</cite>

>A good, open world  xmen video game.<br>
>-<cite>Mars</cite>

>I would create a pretty standard film, but make small adjustments to things and have a 
>different version play in different cities across the world.<br>

>Would never tell anyone which is the "true" copy, and just watch them all try and 
>explain their version of what they saw to people online who saw the same, but different 
>film!<br>

>I would make an RPG where you play as a snail on an epic quest to retrieve your stolen shellâ€¦ 
>only to realize halfway through that youâ€™ve been naked in public the whole time. 
>Boss fights are just impatient gardeners with salt<br>
>-<cite>Simas</cite>


>Portal 3.<br>
>-<cite>Siri</cite>

>The Dark Tower by Stephen King! I get rid of the trash movie they made before and give 
>the world the REAL story.<br>
