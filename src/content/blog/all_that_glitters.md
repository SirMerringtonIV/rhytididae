This week we asked our players "You awake to find that you have the ability to transform in to one animal. You will be able to change between your human form and animal form at will. Which animal do you choose and why?" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>Flea. Start career as an assassin. Jump inside them, turn back into human form, get covered in viscera, but doesn't even matter because 
>im a flea again (free meal too) and i hop away.<br>
>-<cite>KeanuReeee</cite>

<br>
<br>

>Bear<br>
>-<cite>Abner</cite>

>Probably a bird of some kind, like a raven or pigeon. Feels like it'd be helpful for travel 
>and moreso quite innocuous in towns and cities so you can use it for whatever (corporate espionage or smth idk)<br>
>-<cite>Azrael</cite>

>Probably a hawk, just to have to freedom of flight and mobility. At least being a bird of prey will make other animals avoid me<br>
>-<cite>Blace</cite>

>Orange cat. Shared braincell. Ignorance is bliss.<br>
>-<cite>Butterwhale</cite>

>Dasypodidae. What can I say, I like to dice with leprosy<br>
>-<cite>Clithero</cite>

>Peregrine falcon easily. Super fast and free air travel<br>
>-<cite>DeezNutz</cite>

>dragon, of course because he can fly and armoured.<br>
>also, with a bit of magic - i could fly to space.<br>
>-<cite>DraKot</cite>

>bear so i can sleep uninterrupted<br>
>-<cite>Echoes</cite>

>A cat. No one will question if I disappear and sleep all day. Also getting fed by multiple different houses every day? Brilliant<br>
>-<cite>Kaiju</cite>

>House cat. They are common to nearly every environment on earth so blending in while in animal form is easy. They are equipped 
>to defend themselves, yet small enough to escape most situations. Seems pretty versatile all around<br>
>-<cite>KarismaticAlbino</cite>

>Mosquito - it's not only 'invisible' for spying reason but also could inject some diseases (or maybe even poisons) directly into enemy's 
>blood system. Mosquito's vulnerability - is the price for his advantages, need to be very careful (like any other human spy) ðŸ™ƒ<br>
>-<cite>Kilosaw</cite>

>Cat, Iâ€™m lazy<br>
>-<cite>Kubisk</cite>

>Probably a falcon. The ability to fly fast and not really have to worry about predators. My morning commute would be much more enjoyable.<br>
>-<cite>Mars</cite>

>I think a red kite. They're really common in the UK so I would blend in, and it would make getting around so much easier.<br>
>-<cite>Merri</cite>

>I'd pick a ferret form. They're just so cute, and I wish I could sleep like them.<br>
>-<cite>NoelEnough</cite>

>I would choose an orca or like a cuttle fish because I should have been born in the ocean and I would just swim and be in coral and be happy<br>
>-<cite>Pengu</cite>

>Still the Liger, just one of my favorite animals<br>
>-<cite>Ragnar</cite>

>The only correct answer is a dragon. Terrify my enemies, travel long distances at speed (not to mention being able to fly), start enormous amounts 
>of conspiracy theories, see the world, set fire to billionaires' houses with total immunity, then change back, come home and relax with a cup of tea 
>while watching all the shit I did on the news. No need to eat as a dragon as long as I have snacks ready for when I transform back to a human. Perfect ðŸ‘Œ literally 
>the only drawback is that I would have to go somewhere remote in order to transform, but I live pretty close to a national park so I feel like that would work.<br>
>-<cite>Shnail</cite>

>axolotl, no defined age of death, regeneration of whole limbs, happy.<br>
>If human do bad, return to axolotl and be at once ok.<br>
>-<cite>Sinksmith</cite>

>Quetzalcoatlus, is a dinosaur and is the largest bird to ever live on the earth i choose this big birdo cos i reckon i could get many people on my back/in my claws 
>while flying places and i would look *really* cool.<br>
>If we donâ€™t allow dinos then a brown bear to give the best warm furry hugs to people.<br>
>-<cite>Siri</cite>

>A sloth, ya girl needs a nap.<br>
>-<cite>Snailady</cite>

>i wanna be a shark so i can destroy everyone in a water race<br>
>-<cite>Snailcayn</cite>

>Human since Iâ€™m already a camel<br>
>-<cite>Snailor</cite>

>Housecat, I need more naps<br>
>-<cite>Stationaryevent</cite>

>I would want the ability to transform into The bald eagle  I think it would be  pretty cool to fly<br>
>-<cite>Wilsperho</cite>

>Probably a wolf. Then I can get sweet howling pictures for t-shirts!<br>
>-<cite>Zero</cite>
