This week we asked our players "Would you rather make $2 of your currency for every french fry you eat in a day, or $1 for every push up you do in a day for the rest of your life?" 

Here are their answers!

<h4>Winner, mascot for the week</h4><br>

>1 for push ups<br>
>-<cite>Abner</cite>


>For your own health and wellbeing you gotta choose the push ups man<br>
>-<cite>Azrael</cite>


>It would be a better incentive to get the $1 per push up for both health and potatoes are really filling.<br>
>-<cite>Blace</cite>


>Push ups would be the best choice imo, but god I could crush some French fries. I would pick the push ups against my better judgement however<br>
>-<cite>DeezNutz</cite>


>Every push up, I would legit make it my job to do as many pushups as I could everyday. I would get in shape and have extra spending $<br>
>-<cite>diskolemonade</cite>


>While I would like to say dollar per push-up as motivation to get healthier and make more money, I fear my love for fried potatoes is too strong. I'm gonna have to say 2 per fry in a day.<br>
>-<cite>Echoes</cite>


>I was gonna say pushups but! You didn‚Äôt specify how long a French fry had to be. So I‚Äôd go with French fries and go somewhere where they‚Äôll make them super small like fry bits so I can eat like a HUGE amount but it‚Äôs not really and make bank<br>

>I'd rather make $5 for every McDonald's ice cream cone I eat per day, except the machine is always "broken" so I'm broke too üò≠ I scream, you scream, we all scream 'cause there's no ice cream!!<br>
>-<cite>KarismaticAlbino</cite>


>Easy - do 2 pushups, get money and buy french fry üòÖ<br>
>-<cite>Kilosaw</cite>


>Pushup<br>
>-<cite>Kubisk</cite>


>I hate push ups, but I‚Äôll put my body through the gauntlet for money. Plus, I‚Äôd ideally earn more over my lifetime. AND eating all those fries would make me detest french fries and their smell after and no one should live with that burden<br>
>-<cite>luigi0706.</cite>


>French fries<br>
>-<cite>Mars</cite>


>I think I could eat more french fries than do push ups in a day, so I gotta go $2 per fry<br>
>-<cite>Merri</cite>


>2$ for every french fry I eat in a single day vs 1$ for every push up I do for the rest of my life? Push ups.<br>
><br>
>If it's fries for the rest of my life, I'm taking the fries option. Average McDonalds large fries is about 100. That's $200. 500ish calories. That's a 10k run. I'd get paid 200$ to run a 10k and eat some fries. That's 200$ for an hours exercise. I do that for free most days.<br>
><br>
>But if it's push ups for the rest of my life, fries just for a day, I'm doing the push ups and I'm gonna get swole.<br>
>-<cite>ObiJimbob</cite>


>Push  ups. Not a fan of the french fry. Potayto potahto<br>
>-<cite>OHeck</cite>


>Push ups PLEASE IM BROKE PLS HELP ME DO YOU HAVE THE LINK HELLO THE LINK DO YOU HAVE THE LINK EXCUSE ME IM IN GRAVE NEED OF MONIES HELLO<br>

>$2 per fry‚Ä¶I‚Äôd house some fries<br>
>-<cite>Ragnar</cite>


>Can I eat a French fry whilst doing a push up to make ¬£3? Would encourage me to do the exercise TBH<br>
>-<cite>Rockbadger32</cite>


>Ignoring the question this week because I finally got over 100 million power and I want to revel in that for a little while ‚ò∫Ô∏è<br>
>-<cite>Shnail</cite>


>$2 a day for the fries<br>
>-<cite>sircraig</cite>


>2$ for each french fry<br>
>since you have not specified potato french fry i am going to make french fries out of a variety of foods in order  to get a balanced diet and then eat nothing but these french fried foods for breakfast lunch and dinner for the rest of my life<br>
